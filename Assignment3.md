# Redesigned 

As a filmmaker, the title "Which is the Best Performing Marvel Movie?" captured my attention. I chose this visualization because it provided comprehensive data on various performance metrics. However, the sheer amount of detail could be streamlined, especially for viewers who want a quick comparison of films based on box office performance, it is hard to incorporate all value. Additionally, I wanted to see if there was a pattern between budget size and the percentage of budget recovered, which the original visualization hinted at but could present more clearly. Also, placing the x-axis in the middle at a 500% value (rather than starting from 0%) was confusing, as it initially looked like a negative value, so I wanted to improve it for a clearer look.


Here are my redesigned 4 different visualizations.

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1731638408166' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;Marvelmovies1113_Assignment3&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Marvelmovies1113_Assignment3&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;Marvelmovies1113_Assignment3&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>               
<script type='text/javascript'>                   
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1731638408166');                  
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];              
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='2027px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='2027px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1227px';}                   
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                   
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);              
</script>

As I went through the visualization, I started making a few adjustments to improve the storytelling. First, I liked the original black background and the clean typography; it fits well with the film industry theme. But to make the data pop, I decided to switch to a white background so the colors representing each movie would stand out more clearly. I also tried adding character icons for each franchise but found that using text was cleaner and less overwhelming.
The x-axis was also an issue. In the original, it was centered at 500%, which was confusing and made it look like it was negative at first. So I reset it to zero, making it feel more straightforward.
As I redesigned, I thought about who would be using this data. Film production companies, distribution agencies, and marketing teams would all want clear benchmarks for decision-making for further production development and business strategies. So, I focused on making metrics like budget recovery and audience scores more prominent. I noticed that the original chart lacked dollar signs or “M” for million, so I added them in the tooltips to make the numbers clearer by adjusting number properties adding ‘$’ in prefix and ‘M’ in suffix.
From the feedback, I knew the colors needed to match each franchise better—like red for Spider-Man or blue for Captain America. I also matched the colors of the text labels to the chart markers for readability. The original design was interactive, requiring the viewer to click through sections, which I found too cumbersome. I kept in mind that the primary audience likely knows the Marvel franchises already, so I focused on making it more intuitive without needing to click around.
