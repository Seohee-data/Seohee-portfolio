# About me
Hello! My name is Seohee Lee, and I am a second year masters of arts management student at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Heinz College. My background as an independent filmmaker for a decade includes experience as both a director and producer of 10 films. As an independent filmmaker and arts administrator, coupled with my current Arts Management studies, I find the intersection of advocacy for arts and audience engagement particularly compelling.
My enthusiasm for data analytics and visualization has found a perfect outlet in arts management, where I use these tools to uncover meaningful patterns and communicate complex insights about audience engagement and artistic impact. Currently, I'm leveraging these skills as the data manager for my capstone project, a semester-long group project with our client, the Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama for the planning of a Center for New Works Development.
