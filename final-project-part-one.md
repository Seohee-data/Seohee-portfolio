# Outline

### Title: Invisible Neighbors from North Korea

This project explores the journey of North Korean defectors, focusing on their reasons for escaping, their routes, and their integration into South Korea. Using government data, personal stories, and visualizations, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the defection process. The narrative begins with an overview of life in North Korea, characterized by economic instability and political oppression, followed by trends in defection over the years. A map of escape routes will illustrate the paths defectors take, highlighting the time involved in reaching freedom. 

The project also examines the dangers defectors face on the way. Then, I will present data on settlement status, professional and academic backgrounds, and economic activities to highlight the disparities between defectors' previous lives and their new realities. Ultimately, I aim to urge greater support for defectors and raise awareness about their invisible presence in society.


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

My main data source is the Ministry of Unification, a South Korean government department, provides reliable information on North Korean defectors entering South Korea. I’ll also use case studies from articles, U.S. government reports, and UN documents on North Korean defectors.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
