# User research 

## Target audience
> The **target audience** for this project includes **human rights organizations**, and **the general public** interested in humanitarian issues and North Korean defectors.

> *I hope to inform individuals who influence or support policies for defectors and to raise awareness among those unfamiliar with their struggles. Therefore, the project focuses on North Korean defectors with their backgrounds, including varying age groups, escape routes, and traumatic experiences. Additionally, the story aims to resonate with advocates for refugee rights and those invested in fostering global empathy and action to support them.*

| Research Synthesis                   | Anticipated Changes for Part III      |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Insights from interviews indicate the title is clear but could be enhanced with a subtitle for better engagement. | Add a subtitle to make the title more engaging and descriptive. |
| Visualizations are helpful but require better color schemes and simpler categorization (e.g., avoid excessive segmentation like gender). | Update visualizations with improved color schemes and merge unnecessary categories to focus on totals. |
| Personal stories and additional quotes could enhance relatability and deepen audience engagement. | Include more quotes or stories from defectors to humanize the data. |
| A map with paths and distances of defectors' journeys could provide a clearer understanding of their routes. | Add a map showing escape routes, distances, and key locations. |
| Data on mental health and community support is missing but essential for providing a holistic view of the challenges defectors face. | Integrate mental health and community care data to emphasize the importance of these aspects. |
